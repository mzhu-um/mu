* IDEAS

Ideas for future enhancements. We collect those here so they don't clutter up
the Github issue list, i.e. without any clear plan for adding in the near
future.

- Ability to _mute_ message threads. This is useful but also requires quite bit of
  extra infra; we could add some blacklist for "muted" messages, perhaps on the
  'mu server' side, but then we'd need some way to manage that (ie., unmute).
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/636

- Support automatic handling for List-Unsubscribe headers
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/2623 This seems useful, but probably
  requires a lot of testing to get right.

- Allow for *muting* messages https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/636 Useful;
  probably need to do this by *remembering* the thread-id of muted messages; and
  management (unmute etc.). Perhaps at the mu side, a list of thread-id to add
  to each query for what *not* to match.

- Support *creating* calendar invitations.
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/2308
  Shouldn't be _too_ hard, for someone that uses the functionality.

- Support mu4e-mark-handle-when also for when leaving emacs
  (kill-emacs-query-functions).
  https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/2649

- Make sorting stable if there are multiple messages with the same date. We
  _could_ do this by adding some random millisecs to each messasge's timestamp; _or_
  complicating the search (i.e., the message hash?). Maybe leave as is?

- Include "message summary" in message information, for display in the headers
  buffer: https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/1821 It's not so easy to get a
  useful one line description... perhaps the first line after the "Dear x,"?
  Moreover, this requires new functionality on the headers-view side as well.

- Support indexing PDF (and other) attachments. This can be done extending
  process_message_part in mu-message.cc; instead of using something
  PDF-specific, we could pipe a PDF through some tool to extract text; and we'd
  need some way for users to specify a MIME-type => tool mapping  (in Config).
