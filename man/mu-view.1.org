* NAME

mu-view - display an e-mail message file

* SYNOPSIS

mu [common options] view [options] [<file> ...]

* DESCRIPTION

*mu view* is the *mu* command for displaying e-mail message files. It works on
message files and does =not= require the message to be indexed in the database.

The command shows some common headers (From:, To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Subject: and
Date:), the list of attachments and either the plain-text or html body of the
message (if any), or its s-expression representation.

If no message file is provided, the command reads the message from
standard-input.

* VIEW OPTIONS

** --format,-o  = <format>
use the given output format, one of:

- ~plain~ - use the plain-text body; this is the default
- ~html~ - use the HTML body
- ~sexp~ - show the S-expression representation of the message

** --summary-len=<number>
instead of displaying the full message, output a summary based upon the first
=<number>= lines of the message.

** --terminate
terminate messages with \\â€‹f (=form-feed=) characters when displaying them. This is
useful when you want to further process them.

** --decrypt
